written_1: "The colour on the computer screen and the colour on the printed page refer to two different ways of mixing colours, namely, additive and subtractive. However, colour is created in our minds; the mixing is optical. Our understanding of colours, and the methods of their reproduction, has a long and fascinating history. The two stories of the ways of mixing colours are, of course, intertwined. These are also the stories of lively interactions between Science and Art."
