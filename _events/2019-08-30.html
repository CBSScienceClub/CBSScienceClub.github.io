written_1: "Language is a powerful tool for communication. All living beings use their own language to emote, convey, socialize, bring about changes in society and evolve. In each instance, the individual who communicates, the language that is used, who do they communicate with and what is communicated dictates the endpoint. This is extremely crucial and a small error in the path may result in catastrophic effect. Likewise, proteins use specific languages when they communicate with each other. There are close encounters of the first degree and there are larger ripples depending on what is the message, what is the stimulus and who are the players. There is a social network like interactions within which codes are used for the rapid and appropriate execution of functions and this wiring is unique to a cell type. <br><br> Understanding these codes of communication, interpreting them, providing the context to the language spoken and exploiting the information for managing diseases is my passion. In one such journey, we have moved from almost zero knowledge on a specific protein to a state where we are able to edit the code and provide a context for possible treatment opportunities in cancer. While the horizon keeps expanding, we can peek into what lies beyond the few turns and junctions. During the talk, I hope to share this small treatise with you in a language that I hope you will understand."
