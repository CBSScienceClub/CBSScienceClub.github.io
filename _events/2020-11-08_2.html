written_1: "Amidst the current pandemic, UM-DAE CEBS is welcoming its 14th batch of students this year. Much like every year, prospective students, interested in making our centre and its curriculum their home for the next five years, will have many doubts/queries about academics, campus-life and their future beyond the institute.<br>As students of the institute, we have felt that there are many aspects of the centre that need to be discussed and understood. Hence, we are curating an event to help make the applicants an informed choice about joining our institute on Sunday, 8th November, 2020.<br>The aim of this event is to give the student applicants a glimpse of the research-oriented, five-year integrated M.Sc. coursework, and the way CEBS is a suitable opportunity for their lives and careers." #content
