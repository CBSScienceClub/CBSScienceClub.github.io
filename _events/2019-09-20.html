written_1: "This talk will explore the notions of determinism, randomness, predictability, and unpredictability both in the natural sciences as well as in mathematics. Why are some physical phenomena, such as the trajectory of a ball or the orbits of the planets, so predictable, while others, such as the weather or tossing a coin, are so unpredictable? The focus of the talk will be some simple mathematical models through which we will try to understand the features that distinguish, and possibly characterise, these different types of behaviour. Without entering into any technicalities I will finish the talk by explaining some still unresolved open problems in mathematics which are motivated by these kinds of questions."

written_2: "Prof. Stefano Luzzatto is a Research Scientist in the Mathematics section of The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, Italy. He obtained his PhD in Dynamical Systems in 1995 from the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), Trieste, Italy and the National Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Subsequently, he joined the Mathematics Department of the University of Warwick as Research Associate-Lecturer and that of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology as a Lecturer till the year 2000. He served as Senior Lecturer and Reader at the Imperial College London till 2009 before his present affiliation. <br><br> Prof. Luzzatto has been coordinating the activities in Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory within the Mathematics Section of ICTP, and his research interests lie in the Stochastic properties of deterministic dynamical systems. He is also involved in the organisation of many schools and workshops both in Trieste and elsewhere, including in the developing countries, supporting mathematicians working with few resources."
