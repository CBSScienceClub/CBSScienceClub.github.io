written_1: "Sleep pressure and sleep depth are key regulators of wake and sleep. Current methods of measuring these parameters in Drosophila melanogaster have low temporal resolution and/or require disrupting sleep. Here we report novel analysis tools for high-resolution, non-invasive measurement of sleep pressure and depth from movement data. Probability of initiating activity, P(Wake), measures sleep depth while probability of ceasing activity, P(Doze), measures sleep pressure. In vivo and computational analyses show that P(Wake) and P(Doze) are largely independent and control the amount of total sleep. We also develop a Hidden Markov Model that allows visualization of distinct sleep/wake substates. These hidden states have a predictable relationship with P(Doze) and P(Wake) suggesting the methods capture the same behaviors. Importantly, we demonstrate that both the Doze/Wake probabilities and sleep/wake substates are tied to specific biological processes. These new metrics provide greater mechanistic insight into behavior than measuring the amount of sleep alone."

written_2: "Prof. Leslie Griffith is the Director of the Volen National Centre for Complex Systems and a former Chair of the Biology department, both at Brandeis University, Massachusetts, USA. Prof. Griffith pursued her undergraduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981) and did her Doctor in Medicine (1989) and doctorate studies (1989) at Stanford University. Subsequently, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology (1989-1992). <br><br> Prof. Griffith was named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), in 2017 for her contributions and scientific leadership in the field of Neuroscience. She is a Nancy Lurie Marks Chair in Neuroscience (2012-present). She is a member of The Society for Neuroscience, The Royal Academy of European Doctors and The American Physiological Society. <br><br> The Volen National Centre for Complex Systems was formed for the purpose of studying the brain and intelligence; Prof. Griffith is currently the principal investigator at the Griffith Lab which is a part of the centre. Her current research at the Griffith lab ranges from the biochemistry of neuronal signal transduction, in particular, the role of CaMKII in memory formation, to the hierarchical relationships between complex behaviours such as sleep and learning using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism."
