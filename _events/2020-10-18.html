written_1: "The talk will be in the format of exchanging personal views and experiences in following the passion of doing research in basic science, especially when faced with a highly competitive, even commercial environment. We will discuss the conflicting demands of science education. What should be required of a genuine education leading towards science research, with imagination, creativity, and originality being the most important part of it, and what is served instead in the menu at our educational institutions where precisely these elements are totally missing. The central focus of the discussion will be 'the interest in the subject', the underlying theme of 3-Idiots.  " #content
