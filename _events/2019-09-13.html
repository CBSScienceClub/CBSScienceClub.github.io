written_1: "Materials like sand which are made of a large number of grains, challenge our basic notions of what it means to be a solid, liquid or gas. Taking a small number of particles and some basic rules, some of the fundamental issues in science will be addressed through a series of arguments and observations."

written_2: "Prof. Shankar Ghosh is a faculty member at the Soft Matter Physics Group of the Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science (DCMPMS) at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. He obtained his PhD from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in the year 2005, and subsequently joined TIFR as an Associate Professor. His group is interested in understanding non-intuitive phenomena with everyday materials like the peeling of paint and the formation of clouds. Questions of basic and general nature are extracted from those phenomena and experiments are devised to find precise answers about them in model systems that retain the essence of the original observations."
