written_1: "Given a quadratic equation, the quadratic formula tells us what the roots are in terms of the coefficients in the equation. The question we will explore in this talk is whether we have a similar formula for polynomials of higher degree. A remarkable result of Abel states that such a formula is not possible for an arbitrary polynomial of degree 5.<br><br>How does one prove something cannot be done? We will see an approach to such problems, by focussing on the idea behind Abel's proof." #content
