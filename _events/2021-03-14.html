written_1: "Abstraction plays a very important role in mathematics. It has led to development of entirely new domains and concepts that would have been difficult to find otherwise. In this talk, I will demonstrate this using the most fundamental concepts of mathematics: arithmetic and geometry. Their abstraction led to understanding of commonality between them, as well as applications that form the bedrock of modern life." #content
written_2: "Prof. Manindra Agrawal is the N. Rama Rao Chair Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. He did his B.Tech (1986) in Computer Science and Engineering and his PhD (1991) in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur. Subsequently, he became a fellow at the School of Mathematics, SPIC Science Foundation, Madras and a Humblodt fellow at the University of Ulm, Germany after which he joined as a faculty at IIT Kanpur. Currently, he is also an Adjunct Professor at Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI) and Senior Faculty Associate at International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), Bengaluru.<br>Prof. Agrawal’s research work mainly involves the areas of Complexity theory, Computational Number theory and Cryptography. He is well-known for his work on the AKS Primality test, subsequently named after him. The algorithm, which he published in 2002 along with Dr. Neeraj Kayal and Prof. Nitin Saxena at IIT Kanpur, is the first such algorithm that tests whether “any” general number n is prime or not, in polynomial time. It is also the first algorithm that did not depend on any unproved hypotheses or conjectures!<br>Working in the field of cryptography, Prof. Agrawal has also designed encryption algorithms for the Indian Armed Forces. Recently, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, he has been appointed to a committee set up by the Central Government to extensively model the spread of infection.<br>With over 25 years of experience in teaching various courses at IIT Kanpur, he is known for his refreshing teaching style and methods. He has won several awards and prizes over the years including, the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award (2003), ICTP prize (2003), the Gödel Prize (2006), and the Infosys Mathematics Prize (2008) for his work on complexity theory. He is also a fellow of all the three science academies in India."
