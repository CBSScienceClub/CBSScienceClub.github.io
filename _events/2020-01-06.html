written_1: "I would like to pose the following two questions: <br><br> (1) Entropy is often said to be a measure of disorder. Can increasing disorder bring about an ordered state? <br><br> (2) The response of a system is measured by how its properties change when a field is applied. Can the response of a system be measured without putting on a field? <br><br> I will argue that the answer to both questions is 'Yes' and provide examples of physical systems which illustrate this."

written_2: "Prof. Mustansir Barma is a statistical physicist, he has worked extensively on the dynamics of systems in and out of equilibrium, disordered driven systems and theory of phase transitions. Prof. Barma is presently Professor Emeritus and DAE-Homi Bhabha Chair Professor at the TIFR Centre for Interdisciplinary Sciences in Hyderabad. Prior to his appointment in Hyderabad, Prof. Barma was a faculty member at TIFR Mumbai for more than three and a half decades. From 2007 to 2014, he served as the Director of TIFR and retired as Distinguished Professor in 2015. <br><br> Prof. Barmaâ€™s research activity involves seeking an understanding of Fluctuations and Random Walk processes. Fluctuations play a significant role in the remarkable universality observed near the critical points of several systems such as fluids, magnets, etc. An interesting highlight of his work has been the revelation that although order is in general destroyed by fluctuations larger than the average, there are notable exceptions in which a system exhibits the phenomenon of Fluctuation Dominated Phase Ordering, whereby fluctuations and order are coexistent."
