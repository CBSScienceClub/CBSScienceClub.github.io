written_1: "Chemical reactions form the basis for life. The diversity of reactions and their complex biochemical networks that control us ultimately has a universal origin: The idea of a “reaction” clock. In this talk, I will enumerate that all bond breaking steps across the entire chemical space can be projected back to a common unit of “reaction” time: the fundamental vibrational time period!"

written_2: "Dr. Jyotishman Dasgupta, better known as JD, is an associate professor at the Department of Chemical Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. His research work started with a Ph.D. on unravelling the mechanistic details of the oxygenic photosynthesis process, under the guidance of Prof. Charles Dismukes at Princeton University. Subsequently, his interest shifted towards understanding the excited state dynamics of photoactive proteins and worked with Prof. Richard A. Mathies from UC Berkeley for his postdoctoral degree. He derived his current research interest from his post-doctoral days and his work aims at developing a unified mechanism of photoactive systems and molecular materials for light harvesting technology. <br><br> Apart from his research work, he is involved in organizing colloquiums at TIFR, and has a keen interest in science communication too. A congenial personality, he is very enthusiastic about the small things in life. He is always involved in discussions and keeps the atmosphere joyful!"
