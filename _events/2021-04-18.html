written_1: "In this lecture, I will highlight how a computational mathematician operates his research program through three illustrative examples, one from geophysics, one from climate science and one from biology. The aim would be to convey the work pipeline consisting of mathematical modelling of natural phenomena, analysis of the resulting models, design of efficient algorithms, their implementation on state of the art computing platforms and seamless integration with data." #content 
written_2: "Siddhartha Mishra is currently a Professor of Applied Mathematics at ETH Zürich, Switzerland. Prof. Mishra completed his B.Sc (Hons) in Mathematics and Physics from Utkal University in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. He then joined the MS program in Mathematical Sciences jointly run by IISc and TIFR in Bengaluru and finished his MS-PhD in 2005. For his post-doc, he worked at the University of Oslo, and subsequently held faculty appointments at ETH Zürich and the University of Oslo, before returning to ETH as an Associate Professor in 2012. He has been a full Professor at ETH since 2015. <br> His research interests include Numerical Analysis, Non-linear Partial Differential Equations, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Computational Plasma Physics, modelling and simulation. His work spans a wide range of fields, from geophysics to Climate science to biology. Many physical phenomena are modelled by some kind of fluid flow whose mathematical description involves nonlinear partial differential equations. Doing this is often difficult because the solutions are not smooth and develop shocks that need to be tracked accurately. Such problems occur in a range of areas, from aerodynamics to weather prediction to biological systems, and Prof. Mishra has made outstanding contributions by constructing numerical methods, analyzing mathematically their effectiveness and implementing them to solve concrete real-world problems in these fields. Amongst his various contributions, he has designed stable difference schemes for approximating the solutions of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws.<br>For his work, he has won several awards and recognitions, like the Richard von Mises prize by GAMM (2015), the ICIAM Collatz Prize (2019) and the Infosys Prize (2019). He was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Rio de Janeiro in 2018.<br> As a young high school student, Siddhartha Mishra had aspired to be a physicist. However, his serendipitous decision to accept a math scholarship during his undergraduate days changed his plans of pursuing physics, subsequently paving the road towards a passionate career in mathematics.."
