written_1: "An underground laboratory in India to house a large detector for neutrinos was first discussed by the Indian particle physics community 20 years ago. The INO collaboration, now involving researchers at 20 Indian institutions, proposed the construction of a 50 kton magnetised iron calorimeter - spurred on by the award of the Nobel Prize in Physics (2002) for the discovery of cosmic neutrinos. With an approved budget of over rupees 1000 cr, the detector was to be constructed by 2012. However, protests by environmental activists required the project site to be relocated in 2009 from Singara in the Nilgiris to the Bodi Hills in Theni district, Tamilnadu. Subsequently, a series of lawsuits filed by NGOs, as well as a campaign by a  politician to generate fears about neutrinos amongst the local people have held up the project to the present day. The strong support for INO by all Indian Science Academies as well as the international scientific community has not sufficed to make the case, nor has the award of the Nobel Prize in Physics (2015) for the discovery of neutrino oscillations which INO would study in detail. Meanwhile, similar experiments are nearing completion in China, Japan & the USA and will likely make new discoveries.<br>In this talk, I will present why INO is scientifically interesting, as well as its particular relevance to India as an advanced training ground for scientists and engineers. The concerns raised about INO will be critically discussed. The audience will then be invited to engage in a broader discussion of the deeper reasons underlying the INO debacle and the lessons to be learnt." #content
written_2: "Prof. Subir Sarkar is a Professor of Physics at the Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford and an Adjunct Professor at the Raman Research Institute, Bangalore. He obtained his Ph.D from TIFR (1982), where he worked as a research associate in the Cosmic Rays Group (1979-84). Subsequently, he has held various visiting positions at CERN, Geneva, the Department of Astrophysics at the University of Oxford and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. <br>His research interests lie on the interface between fundamental physics and astrophysics and cosmology. His key contributions have been in cosmic ray phenomenology, in using the early universe as a laboratory for new physics, and in seeking a physical understanding of dark matter and dark energy. Apart from the theoretical aspects of the subject, he is also involved in the IceCube Collaboration since 2004 and the Cherenkov Telescope Array experiments since 2006.<br>An eloquent speaker and an active researcher, Prof. Sarkar has been involved in science education, communication and outreach. He has given multiple public talks, organised various schools on cosmology, and has worked with Eklavya, an NGO to help launch a monthly science newsletter in regional Indian newspapers. A detailed list of his talks and outreach activities can be found here.<br>Pertaining to his interest in understanding dark energy, he has been highly critical of the experiments conducted, the selection biases in the analyses and the inferences obtained therewith, and has been advocating for better transparency in the research community. Here is a video interview where he speaks on similar concerns."
