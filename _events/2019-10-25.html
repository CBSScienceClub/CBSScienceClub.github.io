written_1: "In this talk, I would explain the hypothesis of quarks as building blocks of protons and neutrons, the curious behaviour of strong interactions at short distances, and the conjectured confinement of quarks. Then I will indicate how the concept of a 'string' binding quarks to each other has led to a new kind of theory called String Theory. This theory turns out to have many unexpected properties including the natural incorporation of gravity as a quantum force and the unification of fundamental interactions."
