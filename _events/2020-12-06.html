written_1: "We all talk about 'immunity' to SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the COVID-19 epidemic. We talk about 'not having immunity' and therefore having severe illness, we talk about 'increasing immunity', we talk about using vaccine/s to 'get immunity'. What does all this talk of 'immunity' against this virus mean? How does 'immunity' work? We will talk about how there is not one thing called 'immunity', but a set of very diverse physiological responses that sometimes function together as 'immunity' (and sometimes not!). We will also talk about what the field knows and what it does not know, both about immunity to viruses generally, and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in particular.<br><br>Science in COVID times...<br>The interaction will be around the perception of ‘science’ during the pandemic. In these unusual times, should we be worried more, or less, about any lack we perceive of 'scientific temper' in society? Is there a specific societal responsibility on 'scientists' during such times (as opposed to 'normal' times)? Even if there is, can there be very different responses among 'scientists'? What could be the origin of such differences of perspective? How different is the relationship between science and society going to be in the post-covid world (there will be one!)?" #content
