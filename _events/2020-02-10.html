written_1: "Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) was the cradle of many pioneering Indian high energy physics experiments for about four decades, starting from the early 1950s. Being home to one of the deepest mines in the world, KGF offered a natural advantage to conduct many cosmic ray and neutrino physics experiments. This informal talk will provide a historical perspective and flavour of experimental physics pursued there. Stories of some of those experiments, detectors and very creative technologies deployed then will be narrated. Some interesting facts and facets of the land and life at KGF will be shared." #content
written_2: 'Dr. Satyanarayana Bheesettee is an experimental physicist at the Department of High Energy Physics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai. Trained initially as an engineer, he joined TIFR in 1983. He has worked on many major particle physics experiments, including a series of underground experiments at Kolar Gold Fields, the D-Zero experiment at Fermilab, Chicago and the CMS experiment on LHC at CERN, Geneva. He is currently engaged in building the Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) experiment at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) near Madurai. <br><br> Apart from his endeavours in experimental physics, he loves to interact and have scientific discussions with college students from all around the city. He is also the coordinator of the ASET colloquium at TIFR and plays an active role in connecting the scientific community. <br><br> The "land and life" at KGF has had a distinct past, and it will be an enriching experience for all of us to get a first-hand account of the Science done there. Let us all look forward to our active participation in the session.'
