written_1: "Neurons appear central to animal life. They mediate a number of behaviours ranging from escape responses to memory. Are neuronal cells special? What is present in a single neuron that allows them individually and collectively in a circuit to execute a variety of functions? I will discuss the value of using different model systems and how studying a simple soil-dwelling fruit-loving transparent nematode can allow you to gain insights into a single neuron and the circuit that it is part of." #content
written_2: "Prof. Sandhya Koushika is a Neuroscientist and Associate Professor at the Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. She obtained her PhD in Cellular and Molecular Biology from the Brandeis University, USA and did her post-doctoral work at the Washington University, USA. Prior to her current appointment at TIFR, she was a faculty at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore. <br><br> Prof. Koushika's lab tries to understand the process of cargo transport in Neurons. This process is important for the development of the nervous system and its disruption can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Her lab is interested in identifying molecules and mechanisms that regulate the transport of synaptic vesicles and mitochondria. She has been awarded the International Early Career Scientist Award by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for her work. <br><br> For more info: http://www.tifr.res.in/~dbs/faculty/koushika/index.html"
