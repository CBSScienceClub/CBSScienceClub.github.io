written_1: "We have all studied in high school about a small sphere falling through air due to gravity, and reaching a terminal velocity due to Stokes drag. Is there anything much more dramatic happening in a dust storm, a snow avalanche, raindrops falling through the air or marine snow in the ocean? Is everything understood? I'll answer this with a ‘no’ and explain some open questions. I'll talk in particular about our recent work on Basset history and on caustics (I'll explain what these are as well). I hope to convey the excitement in these questions, and to enthuse more people to work in this broad area." #content
written_2: "Prof. Rama Govindarajan is a faculty and the dean of academics at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS) - TIFR, Bengaluru. She did her Bachelors and Masters in Chemical Engineering from IIT Delhi and the Drexel University, Philadelphia, USA, respectively. Afterwards, she worked at the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) - Ministry of Defence, Bengaluru for a few months in 1987, and then went on to work at the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Bengaluru from 1988. During her work at NAL, she also got her PhD in Aerospace Engineering from IISc, Bengaluru. Then, she finished her Post-Doctoral research at the Department of Aeronautics, Caltech, Pasadena, USA in 1994. Since then, she has held faculty positions at JNCASR, Bengaluru (1998-2012), and TIFR, Hyderabad (2012-2016) before joining the Fluid Dynamics group at ICTS in Bengaluru.<br><br>Prof. Govindarajan’s group works on various topics in fluid mechanics. Her research interests encompass several areas such as flow instabilities, modelling the Indian Monsoon and the mixing in the Bay of Bengal. She also works on cloud dynamics, and on understanding how vortices affect the formation and growth of water droplets.<br><br>Passionate about scientific outreach, Prof. Govindarajan has delivered many talks and lectures. She has provided a medium for students to ask questions about how fluid mechanics is indeed a worthwhile topic to study. Whilst citing examples from everyday experiences, Prof. Govindarajan often shares her perspective about fluid mechanics being everywhere.<br><br>She was awarded the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar prize in 2007 and is also a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru, the National Academy of Sciences, Allahabad and the American Physical Society (Division of Fluid Dynamics). She actively advocates for a higher number of women in science and academia and has been mentoring a woman student every year under Dr. Reddy’s Foundation since 2018."
